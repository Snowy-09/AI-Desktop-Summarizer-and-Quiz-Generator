AI Summarization Configurator (Desktop App)

A professional, local desktop application that summarizes text and documents (PDF, DOCX) using Google's state-of-the-art Gemini AI models. This tool features a modern dark-themed UI built with PyQt5, asynchronous background processing, and a local history database.

🚀 Features

Dual AI Modes:

Speed: Uses gemini-2.5-flash for near-instant results.

Accuracy: Uses gemini-2.5-pro for higher quality, detailed summaries.

Document Support: Native support for uploading and parsing .pdf, .docx, and .txt files.

History System: Automatically saves summaries to a local SQLite database. You can view full details of past chats or delete specific records.

MCQ Quiz question generator: Uses gemini-2.5-pro to create a set number of questions with ranging difficulty and gives the answer for each one as well.

Threaded Processing: Keeps the UI responsive while communicating with the cloud API.

Secure Configuration: Supports manual API key entry or automated environment variables for security.



🛠️ Prerequisites

pip install PyQt5 google-generativeai pypdf python-docx

Python 3.10 or newer.

A Google Gemini API Key (Free tier available).

📦 Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME


Install dependencies:
This project uses lightweight libraries and does not require heavy GPU drivers.

pip install -r requirements.txt


🔑 Configuration (API Key)

This application requires a Google Gemini API Key to function.
Get your free key here: Google AI Studio

You have two ways to provide the key:

Option 1: Manual Entry (Easiest)

Paste your key into the "Google API Key" input box at the top of the application window every time you run it.

Option 2: Auto-Load (Recommended)

Set an Environment Variable on your computer, and the app will detect it automatically (leaving the input box empty is fine).

Windows (PowerShell):

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('GEMINI_API_KEY', 'YOUR_KEY_HERE', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)


(Restart VS Code or your Terminal after running this).

Mac/Linux:

export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"


▶️ Usage



Run the application:

python main.py


The Desktop UI will open in a new window.

Paste text or click "Upload Document".

Select your mode (Speed vs Accuracy).

Click Generate Summary.

📂 Project Structure

main.py: The entry point. Launches the PyQt5 application.

desktop_ui.py: Handles the Frontend, Threading, and User Interaction.

summarizer_logic.py: Connects to Google's Gemini API to perform the summarization.

document_handler.py: Utilities for extracting text from PDF and Word documents.

database_manager.py: Manages the SQLite database (app_history.db) for storing/retrieving chat history.

requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.

🛡️ Troubleshooting

API Error (404/Not Found): This usually means your API Key does not have access to the specific model version yet. The app includes a smart fallback to gemini-pro, but ensure your key is active.

"Not Responding": If the app freezes for a split second, it is just initializing the thread. It will recover immediately.

Built with Python, PyQt5, and Google Gemini.

If you get a version conflict error, try using python 3.11 and run the command: py -3.11 -m pip install PyQt5 google-generativeai pypdf python-docx
